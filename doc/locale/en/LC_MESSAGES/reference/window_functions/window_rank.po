"This window function computes the rank of each record with gaps. This is "
"similar to :doc:`window_record_number`. :doc:`window_record_number` computes "
"the number of each record. The number is always incremented but the rank "
"isn't incremented when multiple records that are the same order. The next "
"rank after multiple records that are the same order has gap. If values of "
"sort keys are ``100, 100, 200`` then the ranks of them are ``1, 1, 3``. The "
"rank of the last record is ``3`` not ``2`` because there are two ``1`` rank "
"records."
