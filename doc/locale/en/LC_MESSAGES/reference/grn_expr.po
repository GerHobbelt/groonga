"Conditions for searching records from a database can be represented by "
"conbining condition expressions such as ``equal condition expression`` and "
"``less than condition expression`` with set operations such as ``AND``, "
"``OR`` and ``NOT``. Grn_expr executes those conditions to search records. "
"You can also use advanced searches such as similar search and near search by "
"grn_expr. You can also use flexible full text search. For example, you can "
"control hit scores for specified words and improve recall by re-searching "
"with high-recall algolithm dinamically. To determine whether re-searching or "
"not, the number of matched rescords is used."
